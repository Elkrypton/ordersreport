#Project Plan
## Key Constitutive programs: 
	### BackEnd :
	 #### Forms : input data > serves the primary goal
	 #### DB Forms : storing input data : using built-in django database system
         #### Generating unique QR_CODES for responses
	 #### Generating downloadable/Printable PDF files for the responses/
	 #### Deleting responses

## Keyweaknesses:
	### The fucking front-end:
		#### input forms are fine
		#### Orders listing sucks

### key Security Issues:
	### This feature hasn't been tested yet, since we are still running the web application locally. We will test all possible security scenarios after the phase of deployment.
